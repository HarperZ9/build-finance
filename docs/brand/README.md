# build-finance brand assets

Current assets, rendered on 4 October 2026 from the shared art direction:

- `docs/art/hero-dark.svg`, `docs/art/hero-light.svg`: the README hero, 1280 x 480, text outlined from Hanken Grotesk and Conso.
- `docs/art/social.png`: the GitHub social preview, 1280 x 640.
- The mark: `docs/brand/mark-16.png`, `docs/brand/mark-32.png` and `docs/brand/mark-16.svg` (favicon sizes),
  `docs/brand/mark-64.png`, `docs/brand/mark-512.png` and `docs/brand/mark-tile.svg` (app and listing icons),
  `docs/brand/mark-light.svg` and `docs/brand/mark-dark.svg` (on a page, no tile).
- The lockups: `docs/brand/lockup-horizontal-light.svg`, `docs/brand/lockup-horizontal-dark.svg`,
  `docs/brand/lockup-stacked-light.svg` and `docs/brand/lockup-stacked-dark.svg`.
- `docs/art/receipts.json`: a `superstack.receipt/1` for every PNG, with the seed, the scene hash and the font hashes.

The seed is the repository name. The same seed gives the same SVG bytes.

The record below describes the previous brand render and stays as it was written.

## Previous render

- `build-finance-mark.svg` — square logomark (candlestick ledger on a
  baseline). Use for avatars, favicons, and small placements.
- `build-finance-hero.svg` — wide banner used at the top of the project README.

Palette: the marks use the Project Telos indigo (`#4636e8`) for the ledger
baseline, with profit/loss accents (`#38d39f` / `#ff4d6d`) on a near-black
indigo ground (`#160c28`/`#0a0816`), matching the rest of the build-* family
(see `build-color`, `build-engine`). Assets are SVG so they scale cleanly;
export to PNG only if a raster is required.
